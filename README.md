# IMS-Project-

The Inventory Management System (IMS) is a desktop application designed to efficiently manage and monitor inventory operations within an organization. Built using Python (Tkinter) for the user interface and SQLite for the database, the system provides a simple yet powerful platform to track products, suppliers, categories, employees, and sales records in real time.

The project aims to automate manual inventory tracking processes, reduce human error, and improve operational efficiency. It offers user-friendly navigation, secure data storage, and reporting capabilities to support decision-making. This IMS is suitable for small to medium-sized businesses seeking an affordable, offline solution for managing their stock and resources.
